# calculator

Here we build a simple calculator with add, subtract, divide, and multiply operations.

Dividing by zero should return an error, but it shouldn't break the machine.

There are three seperate variables, for each of the two operands, and the one operator.

There is an operate function which takes an operator and two operands, then calls one of the above functions on the number
